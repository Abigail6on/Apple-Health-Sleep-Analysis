# Apple-Health-Sleep-Analysis

**An evolving data analysis project analyzing personal health data from Apple Health ‚Äî showcasing exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and continuous learning.**

---

## Project Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and scripts that analyze daily health metrics exported from **Apple Health** ‚Äî including sleep duration, heart rate, and physical activity ‚Äî to uncover insights, build predictive models, and sharpen data science skills.  
All code and analysis are updated regularly as part of my **continuous learning journey**.

## Key Modeling Tasks
Each task includes:
- Data preparation  
- Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Evaluation and comparison

### 1. Predict Active Energy Burned (Regression)
- **Target**: `ActiveEnergyBurned`
- **Best performer**: Linear Regression ‚Äî *R¬≤ = 0.8157*

### 2. Predict Walking Speed (Regression)
- **Target**: `WalkingSpeed`
- **Best performer**: Random Forest ‚Äî *R¬≤ = 0.8212*

### 3. Classify Walking Steadiness
- **Target**: `WalkingSteadiness` (Low vs High)
- **Best performer**: Random Forest ‚Äî Balanced ROC AUC and F1 (moderate overall due to class imbalance)

### 4. Classify Active vs Sedentary Day
- **Target**: Based on step count or energy burned
- **Best performer**: Random Forest ‚Äî Accuracy: 0.8152, F1-score: 0.8251, ROC AUC: 0.8948

### 5. Classify Stress Level (based on HRV)
- **Target**: `HeartRateVariabilitySDNN` (High vs Low stress)
- **Best performer**: Random Forest ‚Äî ROC AUC: 0.7621, F1-score: 0.6304

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo or open in **Google Colab**
2. Ensure your **cleaned health data CSV** (e.g., `cleaned_daily_health_data.csv`) is in the correct folder
3. Open and run the notebooks in order ‚Äî starting with EDA, then modeling

> **Note**: All personal data is anonymized or aggregated to protect privacy. Raw Apple Health export files are **not included**.

## Continuous Learning Roadmap
Planned improvements:
- Advanced feature engineering  
- Additional target variables for prediction  
- Time-series forecasting  
- Interactive dashboards (Tableau, PowerBI)
